Map improvements
    Marker clustering
        Zooming out should adjust the max distance setting when calculating cluster centroids

Location Service
    Failure
        If the navigation api fails for whatever reason, we should return an error code that will let us determine where the error came from while determining location.
        We can then try to use Google's api instead.

Smoother loading overlay
    At the moment when we zoom/pan the server responds very quickly. This means that the loadig overlay flashes on the screen.

Report Sighting
    Entire thing needs to be designed and implemented!
